# loading-animation

In this task you'll be developing animation skills to building simple loaders.

1. Using keyframes and the animation property, use the `translateX` property to move the line up 20 pixels, then back down again. In a different animation, use `translateY` to move the line right and left 20 pixels. This should only happen once.
2. This time, use the `skew` properties to shrink and stretch the line. Use the ease-in/out property, but delay the animation so it doesn't simply repeat.
3. Using a property that allows rotation, rotate the line by 90 degrees, then back 120 degrees, then forward to the starting position. It should like a gauge trying to find equilibrium.
4. Get the line to spin clockwise 360 degrees continuously.
5. With 4, see how you can ALSO get the line to move forward and backward (this is challenging!)
